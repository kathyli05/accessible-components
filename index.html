        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          As our world becomes increasingly digital and user interface design
          becomes more complex, it is important that
          <b>all interfaces be designed with accessibility in mind</b>. However,
          many web components (e.g. buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes) are not
          equally accessible for users on different devices and with different
          physical/mental needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This motivated me to investigate <b>checkboxes</b> - a seemingly
          simple but deceptively nuanced UI component - and investigate how
          their inputs and outputs vary across three different platforms. With
          these insights, I then redesigned one of the platform's checkboxes to
          better account for <b>inclusive and intuitive design</b>.
        </p>
        <p>A few notes:</p>
        <div class="text-box">
          <ul>
            <li>
              I use a Thinkpad X14 Carbon and an iPhone 14 for the mobile
              versions. For my laptop browser, I use Google Chrome, and mobile
              browser, I use Safari.
            </li>
            <li>
              I use the word "toggle" to describe the checking or unchecking of
              a checkbox.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="applications">
        <h2>Applications Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I chose to investigate three platforms for my case study - Google
          Forms, Microsoft To-do, and the video game Hades. These three
          platform's checkboxes are all used in different contexts, which I
          figured was useful in comparing their usability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below, I have included images of the checkboxes as they appear in each
          application.
        </p>
        <div class="text-box">
          <ul>
            <b>Note: </b
            >Each diagram represents the typical user flow of going from an
            unchecked to checked checkbox. For concision's sake, I did not
            include going from a checked to unchecked textbox - imagine the
            arrows reversed.
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 id="google-forms">Google Forms</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/forms.svg" alt="Google Forms checkbox example" />
          <figcaption>
            Checkbox interaction in Google Forms. Note that the hover indicator
            is quite faint.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Google Forms uses simple visual indicators and allows clicking on both
          the box and associated label. However, keyboard navigation is
          inconsistent and lacks proper focus feedback.
        </p>

        <h3 id="microsoft-todo">Microsoft To-Do</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/msft.svg" alt="Microsoft To-Do checkbox example" />
          <figcaption>Checkbox interaction in Microsoft To-Do</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Microsoft To-Do provides clear visual and auditory feedback. However,
          accessibility support and general usability worsens for non-mouse
          users.
        </p>

        <h3 id="hades-settings">Hades Settings</h3>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Checkbox interaction in Hades settings menu</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The Hades game settings offer multimodal feedback - visual, audio, and
          haptics - but keyboard accessibility is inconsistent, with confusing
          arrow-key navigation and no visible focus cues.

      <section id="inputs">
        <h2>Input Interactions</h2>
        <p>
          After a basic test of each component and understood the various states
          each component could be used in, I further investigated each
          component's inputs and how they performed in four key aspects of good
          UI design: learnability, memorability, efficiency, and accessibility.
          When interacting with a checkbox, inputs refer to the different ways a
          user can engage with the component, such as clicking with a mouse,
          using keyboard shortcuts, or tapping on a touchscreen. Thus, I
          explored how users interact with each applications' checkboxes across
          mouse, keyboard, and mobile inputs.

                Tabbing through tasks is inconsistent—focus disappears after

        <h2>Output Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          When a user interacts with a checkbox, the component should provide
          clear output signals to reflect its current state. These outputs serve
          as confirmation of an action and are essential for usability and
          accessibility. Outputs can include visual indicators, auditory cues,
          or haptic feedback. They may also be more subtly implemented, such as
          screen reader announcements or focus outlines. Thus, I proceeded by
          analyzing the outputs for each application.

        <h2>State Models</h2>
        <p>
          To better understand the behaviors and limitations of checkbox
          components, I created state models that illustrate how users interact
          with the Google Forms checkbox using two different input methods:
          mouse and keyboard. These diagrams reflect the key states - such as
          hovered, focused, and checked/unchecked - and the transitions
          triggered by user actions like clicking and tabbing.
        </p>

        <h3>Redesign</h3>
        <p>
          Visualizing the interaction flow with these models helped me identify
          usability and accessibility issues. Thus, I chose to change one aspect
          of the component to address these issues -
          <b
            >adding a clearer hover/focus indicator to the entire checkbox and
            its label.</b

          Previously, only the checkbox itself had an indicator, with a much
          lighter color. <b>This was an intentional trade-off </b>I made,
          affecting learnability, memorability, efficiency, and accessibility
          for mouse and keyboard users.

        <h2>Figma Redesign</h2>

        <p>
          After creating my revised state models, I implemented my change
          <b>for mouse users</b>
          visually by recreating the Google Forms checkboxes in Figma and
          replacing the current focus indicator with my design. Below is the new
          user flow.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            My design addresses two accessibility gaps: the almost-hidden
            hover/focus indicator in Google Forms mouse/keyboard navigation and
            the lack of visual alignment between interactive areas and visual
            feedback. This change solves the "mismatch" described by Kat
            Holmes—there is a disconnect between the ability to interact with
            the entire label row and the visual indicator that only appears on
            hover/focus, creating unnecessary precision challenges for users.
          </p>

          <p>
            From my observations, Microsoft To-do’s small checkbox hitbox may
            negatively impact users with motor impairments who rely on touch
            input, while Hades' multimodal feedback (audio, visual, haptic) will
            significantly benefit users with various impairments. Similarly,
            Google Forms' lack of obvious keyboard focus indicators may create
            barriers for visually impaired users relying on keyboard navigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            In component design, it seems that mouse users are most commonly
            prioritized, followed by touch/mobile, and then followed by keyboard
            users. This hierarchy impacts accessibility - keyboard users
            frequently encounter minimal focus indicators and inconsistent focus
            navigation, touch users face small targets, and screen reader users
            may receive inconsistent announcements. This may be frustrating and
            leave them with an incomplete experience. My redesign attempts to
            rebalance this by improving visibility for all input methods without
            adding complexity.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          I learned a lot about accessible design through my analysis and
          redesign of the checkbox component. For one, I've realized how
          important it is to account for
          <b>learnability, memorability, and efficiency</b> when designing
          interfaces. Additionally, I've realized that these small usability
          issues such as a faint hover indicator or non-multimodal forms of
          feedback <b>affect all users of all abilities</b>, not just a specific
          group. Ultimately, accessibility is not about perfection (as seen
          through the tradeoff I made), but rather
          <b>intention and careful design</b>.
